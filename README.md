# ReLe-Final-Project
Final project for reinforced learning. 
This project is the ffinal project for Reinforced Learning. The main purpose of this project is to create a machine learning program that will monitor changes in water lines from satellite imagery. The main model that will be used will be actor-critic, in which the main portion of the program, the actor, will detect what it perceives as changes in shoreline over time. The critic is a much smaller section of the code that will use a test set to give either a correct or an incorrect response to the actor. With the two sections going back and forth over many epochs, the accuracy in shoreline detection increases. I will be posting more information as I gather it, and will post a bibliography in another section for anyone that would like to see where I am coming from on this project.
